# Cinerama

Small tool to toggle a screen black.

I was just watching a series on my triple screens setup (there's no such thing as "enough" screens), and I wanted a quick way to make unused screens black.

**Why not turning them off?**

It's kind of a pain to turn them off, it's take a few seconds to be taken into account by the GPU, the desktop moves a bit, some reduced app are lost and if I receive some message, I'll have to open it in my current screen on top of my series.

Really a rich people problem. But at least, I'll learn how to create this kind of app with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) and a bit of Rust too.
